## 📌 Project Overview  
This project simulated the end-to-end planning and execution of a **residential renovation and expansion project** (“This Old House Project”).  

The objective was to develop a **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)** and detailed project schedule in Microsoft Project for remodeling and renovation of an inherited property. A cost-benefit analysis confirmed renovation was more feasible than building a new home:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.  

The simulation applied professional project management practices to plan tasks, allocate resources, and manage costs under realistic constraints.

## 🛠️ Key Deliverables  
- **Microsoft Project Schedule (`.mpp`)** – Editable project plan with all tasks, dependencies, and resources.  
- **PDF Report (`.pdf`)** – Exported Gantt Chart and Network Diagram for easy viewing.  
- **Subproject Plans** – Linked `.mpp` files to demonstrate modular scheduling.  
- **Resource Sheet** – Defined skilled and general labor, equipment, and materials with assigned costs:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

## 📊 Project Highlights  
- Modeled **60+ interdependent tasks** across major phases: initiation, planning, execution, and close-out.  
- Coordinated **20+ resource types** (carpenters, masons, electricians, plumbers, laborers, equipment, and materials).  
- Integrated **fixed costs** (e.g., architect fee, permits, contractor) and **variable costs** (hourly labor, equipment rentals, materials).  
- Applied **scheduling logic** (FS, SS, lead/lag) to simulate realistic workflows.  
- Used **resource leveling** to avoid over-allocation and balance labor/material usage.  
- Incorporated **milestone reviews** with contractor and bank examiner to track schedule/cost progress.  
- Produced **competitive bid outputs**: shortest schedule, lowest cost, and optimized balance of both.
